         <div class="question">What accomplishment would make you most proud?</div>
         <div class="answer">Making money easily by coding or teaching others. "I used to do takeout for only 4 RMB one
            time, it is labor and not long-term. But now I can earn 60 RMB per hour helping others code to make money."
         </div>

         <div class="question">Who do you admire most and why?</div>

         <div class="question">What change would you like in your daily routine?</div>
         <div class="answer">Go do more cool things, like travel and teach more people.</div>

      <div class="section">
         <h2>üîç Digging Deeper</h2>

         <div class="question">What habit would transform your productivity?</div>
         <div class="answer">Walk, exercise, and talk to someone. Be less silent.</div>

         <div class="question">If money wasn't an issue, what would you teach?</div>
         <div class="answer">How to avoid being poor and how to become rich. "Seemingly just teaching for my own
            achievement - to be honest, I teach just because I want to teach, lol."</div>

         <div class="question">Between leading or working alone, which energizes you?</div>
         <div class="answer">"I want to lead, but I don't know what I'm leading for. Leading for what purpose?
            Persuading others for a dream and being a team."</div>

         <div class="question">What technology skill would multiply your income fastest?</div>
         <div class="answer">Coding, programming</div>

         <div class="question">What's the biggest obstacle to your ideal life?</div>

            AM."</div>

         <div class="question">Current influence status?</div>
         <div class="answer">"I am trying to be an influencer. I have published some things on X (Twitter). On this
            platform I have no influence, but on other platforms like Bilibili and Red Note, I have about 500 fans."

      <div class="section">
         <h2>üöÄ Your Vision & Challenges</h2>

         <div class="question">What programming languages or tech skills would you want to master next?</div>
         <div class="answer">"Vibe coding, not using a special-purpose language, is too basic. I want to have my agents
            do the coding work. I'll be responsible for directing these agents, like Cursor, Claude, GPT, or Deepseek,
            to work for me. I can just use natural language to program, haha. Next, I want to become a master, perhaps a
            full-stack web developer. Although I've done some work in this area, the efficiency is low. I'm thinking
            about a web project that has market potential, more users, and Google AdSense as income."</div>

         <div class="question">If you could build a team tomorrow, what project would you lead them on?</div>
         <div class="answer">"Let's think and talk about the overall future of the AI era. Then, we can build towards
            our dreams. There shouldn't be too much pressure; it should be like doing work freely. Let's give it a try
            over one or two years. We should confirm with each other that we can do it and succeed. Every day, we work
            from morning to night."</div>

         <div class="question">What content gets the best response from your followers?</div>
         <div class="answer">"They just let me come on and go on. Not much deep talk."</div>

         <div class="question">Which influencer's career path do you most admire?</div>
         <div class="answer">"Andrej Karpathy. He is normal but extraordinary in my eyes - normal because he uses some
            web or apps I use, haha, but extraordinary because he has many excellent and far-reaching thoughts."</div>

         <div class="question">What's holding you back from posting more consistently?</div>
         <div class="answer">"Maybe due to sad emotions or being swamped with busy work. Perhaps I haven't received much
            today."</div>

         <div class="question">If you could instantly fix one thing about your current situation?</div>
         <div class="answer">"About LLaVA finetuning, I'm not doing well."</div>
